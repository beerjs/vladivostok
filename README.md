## Who are We Waiting for, or Can I Join?
Literally, anyone, independently from place of work, place of living, sex, preferences or religion. Js - is all that matters. There are two rules only: respect others and don't forget to pay for yourself in pub

## A note about beer :beers:

BeerJS is about creating social spaces to strengthen software communities. There is no requirement to drink to participate.
